***Wrappers for the SPLASH SPH plotting code***

If you work with data from astrophysical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, then this repo may be useful.

This is a very simple set of scripts that allow you to run some of the utilities offered by SPLASH:

without knowing what SPLASH is, or the required commands.  SPLASH is principally a plotting program for SPH data, but it also contains several helpful tools for:

i) converting SPH data from one file format to another,
ii) Binning SPH data into a cartesian grid

and others - see the SPLASH userguide for more.

I've written these scripts as a wrapper - you don't need to know how to operate SPLASH, just ensure that all of its binaries are installed locally

If you find yourself using these scripts a lot, then tell Daniel Price! He may decide to develop these tools further.
